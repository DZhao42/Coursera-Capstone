Given the rapid spread of the coronavirus in New York City, it would be illuminating to see how different types of neighborhoods differed in their COVID-19 case counts.\n\nThis project will first use machine learning to cluster New York City zip codes by type. Then, it will run a statistical analysis comparing COVID case rates among neighborhood clusters. Specifically, neighborhoods will be clustered using K-Means clustering, and then once the clusters are created, an ANOVA analysis on COVID-19 case rates will be used to compare different neighborhood clusters."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Data "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "This project will use venue data collected from FourSquare as well as COVID-19 case rate data provided by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
