Given the rapid spread of the coronavirus in New York City, it would be illuminating to see how different types of neighborhoods differed in their COVID-19 case counts.\n\nThis project will first use machine learning to cluster New York City zip codes by type. Then, it will run a statistical analysis comparing COVID case rates among neighborhood clusters. Specifically, neighborhoods will be clustered using K-Means clustering, and then once the clusters are created, an ANOVA analysis on COVID-19 case rates will be used to compare different neighborhood clusters."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Data "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The datasets used in this project include neighborhood data provided by FourSquare as well as COVID-19 caseload data provided by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\nThe COVID-19 caseload data is broken down by zip code, so neighborhood comparisons will be conducted on the basis of zip code areas. It includes total case count, case rate, death count, and death rate. All of these categories will be analyzed.\n\nBecause the COVID-19 caseload data is broken down by zip code, neighborhood data will also be broken down by zip code. A python geocoder library can be used to convert zip codes into geographical coordinates, which will then be used to collect venue data from FourSquare."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
